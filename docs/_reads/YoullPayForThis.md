My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/8026302244">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Perfect follow-up book to Strong Towns with bits of actual math. I like the conversational style and the unexpected recipe chapter. I like how it talks about the balance sheet equation. Although it could definitely use a bit more exposition around that. As a math person, I feel like there is a bit more simplification than I would have liked. For example, the book talks about loan as using money from the future and surplus as being money earned from the past. This is nice and all, but it would be even better if this is also discussed with respect to the balance sheet equation (which really is indexed by t, time). Alas, math is off-putting, unpopular.
