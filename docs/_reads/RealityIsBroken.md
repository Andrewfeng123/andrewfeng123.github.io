My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7970500128">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Book starts off with a few banger chapters. <br /><br />Really liked the characterization of games as a combination of 4 elements: rule, feedback, goal, and voluntariness. <br /><br />The book acknowledges the various qualities of video games and makes the case that reality should be more like games in these ways. My only issue with it is that the book seems to be giving the game industry too much credit without mentioning the toxic/detrimental parts of games. But I guess that is intentional? I am also not entirely convinced about the potential of Alternate Reality Games. For one, many of the ARGs mentioned in the book simply died off without much traction. Second, participating in such games require intentional effort. Instead, I would be interested in seeing how rules and government policies can be designed so that life can be more game-like, since this requires less intentional effort as they affects everyone.<br /><br />Also wonder what the author would say today about the game industry, with its increasing focus on making money instead of good games.
