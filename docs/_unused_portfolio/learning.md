This is just where I dump (keep track of) my learning progress before they turn into actual projects.

# Math

## [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4)
Looking into proof assistant for formalizing mathematics. I think model theory (and mathematical logic in general) is "under-formalized"!

# Programming

## C++
Even though C++ has always been my main language, I've never gotten the time to properly learn it in depth. That is about to change! 

## Robotics
Finished the course *Modern Robotics* on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics)

The math is a little "incorrect" in the book, I prefer the book by Murray, Li, and Sastry called *A Mathematical Introduction to Robotics Manipulation*. Neither book talks about Lagrangian mechanics in any depth, and for that I recommend the all the classic *Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics* by Arnold!

## Unity's animation system

Resources:
- [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationSection.html)

- [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FhvQDqmgmU&list=PLwyUzJb_FNeTQwyGujWRLqnfKpV-cj-eO&ab_channel=iHeartGameDev) on YouTube (~3 hours)

## Physics Engines

Resources:
- Ian Millington's book
- Real Collision Detection (to read)

Cool to play with:
