Throughout my time as a student, I have taken the following intersting courses (uninteresting courses have been omitted).

## First Year
- MAT157 (analysis): Calculus from scratch, starting from axioms of ordered field satisfying least upper-bound property.
- MAT240/7 (linear algebra): vector spaces.
- CSC148 (programmming): basic python and how to think about recursion.
- CSC240 (intro to TCS): regular languages and how to prove programs correct.
- MAT327 (topology): topological spaces.
- MAT315 (number theory): natural numbers.

## Second Year
- MAT257 (analysis): multivariable calculus and Stoke's theorem on submanifolds of Rn
- MAT267 (ODE and stability): uniqueness and existence of solutions to ODEs.
- MAT309 (logic!): completeness and incompleteness of FOL, along with some model theory.
- MAT347 (algebra in the abstract): groups, rings, and modules.

- STA257 (probability): probability spaces.

## Third Year
- MAT409 (set theory): Some basic set theory, infinite combinatorics, and something about forcing.
