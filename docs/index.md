I recently graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Master's in Pure Mathematics. My research focus was [model theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory), a branch of mathematical logic. Before that, I studied math and CS at the University of Toronto. <!-- In my spare time, you can find me shredding trails on my mountain [bike](/assets/bike.jpg). -->

I am currently on the job market for software engineering. I am interested in projects where the performance/correctness is critical or where math is essential. Currently, I am learning about robotics, modern C++, physics simulation, and some machine learning. See [my learning page](/portfolio/learning).
