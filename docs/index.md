I recently graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Master's in Pure Mathematics. My research focus was [model theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory), a branch of mathematical logic. Before that, I studied math and CS at the University of Toronto. I now work on embedded middleware at Huawei Canada. <!-- In my spare time, you can find me shredding trails on my mountain [bike](/assets/bike.jpg). -->

I am interested in working on open source projects that are relatively low-level. I've dabbled in robotics, modern C++, physics simulation and game dev. See [my learning page](/portfolio/learning).
