I am a masters student in the Department of Pure Mathematics at the University of Waterloo studying model theory. Previously, I studied math and CS at the University of Toronto. In my spare time, you can find me shredding trails on my mountain [bike](/assets/bike.jpg).

Academically, my [coursework](/courses) during university sums up the technical things I know.

On the side, I'm currently learning about robotics and game engine programming! See [my learning page](/portfolio/learning).
